## Question 1:

Instead of one thing that I learned I'm going to do 2. One thing that I learned about the helped me with the development process is how to think about making my code more dry. During the weather app project I couldn't really think about what to do in a certain situation and I ended up making wet code, but after presenting what I had made Justin was able to help me out with what I could do next time to make the code a lot more dry. Another thing that I learned is how good pseudocode can be. I was able to develop a decent pseudocode this time around and when I was stuck I would go back to look at the pseudocode and realize where I was and what I needed to do to continue the process. I made me realize that I put in effort to my pseudocode it makes it a lot easier on me and I can get through my projects a lot quicker.

## Question 2:

What it means to develop good code is to make readable and dry code. When you make your code readable you can put it into a spot where other devs (such as a senior dev) will be able to read and understand everything that is happening within the code (This means formatting the code correctly and also making good pseudocode for other devs as well.) When you make your code dry, that means you are not bloating your file with a lot of repeat. When you don't bloat the code with repeat lines it also makes it easier to read but it also makes the code a lot more efficient since it does not have to load through more lines of code.

## Question 3:

What it means to be a good developer is to be pragmatic. When you do this you can code efficiently and this makes you able to develop good code (like the previous question.) Another thing you are able to do it integrate with a team and communicate well with them making any project a breeze. Good developers are also very well disciplined and have very good work ethics and practices.

## Question 4:

I would say the one thing I hate doing as a programmer is debugging. I do not understand all the error messages yet and so when I get error messages in my console or something does not work the way I want it feels like sometimes it takes me forever to figure out what is going on just because I am not able to understand the certain error code yet.
