## Question 1: What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?
What I have learned about CLIs is how useful they can be. They make it fairly easy to install things into the project (like react) and have them run, as well as they help with adding in the files I need without skipping anything. I still think they are a bit scary though because I am not really sure what they can do to their full extent and some of the questions it asks when installing things I am not very sure about.

## Question 2: If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?
If I were to make a CLI I would make one where you can use it the same as the one now where you can install and add things, but also have a feature where you can add files that already have boiler plate templates (like HTML and CSS like react does) depending on what project youre trying to make.

## Question 3: List some ideas that without a Framework, that would take you a long time to code
Somethings that would take a long time to code without a framework would be a menu. If you were not allowed to use a framework then it would take hours upon hours. You would have to make multiple HTML files, or a lot of HTML in JS and along with that make sure all of it looks nice and displays correctly, where as with react you can just do a couple components and have it change when buttons are clicked.
