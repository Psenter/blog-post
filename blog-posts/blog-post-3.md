## Question 1:

The number one thing that held me back this week was that I was struggling with my pesudocode. I was shown that my pesudocode was not up to par and how that was hold me back. If I put more into the pesudocode and made it able to 'run around the track' once then I feel like it would have been a lot easier for me to get done with the projects this week. Since my pesudocode was not where it should be I struggled a little in my actual code and on what I needed some things to do.

## Question 2 and 3:

One thing I would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript is how to manipulate Dats Structures. I would like to learn a lot more on how to pull, manipulate, and change Key:Value pairs, arrays, and other data structures because it seems like I am able to do a lot with that, like I learned this week (such as making single page applications.) With this it seems like I will be able to figure out a lot more about JavaScript because the project we did showed me how to pull from arrays and change the data to make it match what needed to be on the page.
