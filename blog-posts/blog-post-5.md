## Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?
Personally I think JS frameworks and libraries are easy to an extent. They take a little to learn but once you have learned how to use them and what they are capible of them it makes working in JS a lot easier.

## What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?
I am very interested in learning more about React and Next, both seem to make working in JS a lot easier. Especially when it comes to manipulating the DOM and changing state within JS.

## Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.

One tool I want to learn more about is Angular. It is a framework that boosts the speed, responsive UI, and other factors of your site. It also makes DOM manipulation a lot easier as well.
