# Well, lets get started.
## Blog 1

Before I put anything down, I'm going to let it be known now that I personally think I don't speak that much so my blog will most likely reflect that.

### Question 1:

Ahh, the first week. If I'm going to be honest, I was stressing quite a bit. The prework that was assigned made me think that we were about to just dive straight in and that I was gonna be left in the dust not knowing what was going on. (kinda like this)

But as time went on I learned it wasn't going to be nearly as bad as I thought it was, and I'm actually feeling pretty good about my odds of graduating so far. Just kinda scared about the depths right now.

### Question 2:

I'm honestly pretty excited to learn more about JavaScript, it seems like I could do almost anything I can dream of to a webpage with it when i combine it with HTML and CSS. From what I've seen from it so far, it looks pretty complex but with the help of everyone and if I put in the effort I'm sure I can learn it. (Here I'll show you why I think it's a little complex for me right now.)

```
let button = documnet.createElement('button');
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    button.textContent='Clicked!'
})
```
This looks insane to me but, it's worth a shot to learn it. Especially cause I know I'll need it.

### Question 3:

Honestly, not to much to learn about me in my opinion, I'm pretty surface level for the most part. Some of the only things I can really think of are I'm a god awful cook, I hate twizzlers, swedish fish, and dots (they are an abomination to mankind), and I'm short.
