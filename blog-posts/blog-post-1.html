          <b>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</b>
          Ahh, the first week. If I'm going to be honest, I was stressing quite
          a bit. The prework that was assigned made me think that we were about
          to just dive straight in and that I was gonna be left in the dust not
          knowing what was going on. (kinda like the image shown on the left)
          But as time went on I learned it wasn't going to be nearly as bad as I
          thought it was, and I'm actually feeling pretty good about my odds of
          graduating so far. Just kinda scared about the depths right now.

          <b>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</b>
          I'm honestly pretty excited to learn more about JavaScript, it seems
          like I could do almost anything I can dream of to a webpage with it
          when i combine it with HTML and CSS. From what I've seen from it so
          far, it looks pretty complex but with the help of everyone and if I
          put in the effort I'm sure I can learn it. (Here I'll show you why I
          think it's a little complex for me right now.)<code></br>let button =
          documnet.createElement('button'); button.addEventListener('click', ()
          => { button.textContent='Clicked!' })</code></br> This looks insane to me but,
          it's worth a shot to learn it. Especially cause I know I'll need it.

            <b>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</b>
            Personally I don't think there is a lot to me. I am quiet most the time unless 
            I really know the person and I am pretty surface level for the most part. 
            Some of the only things I can think of are that I am a terrible cook, and I'm a short person.
