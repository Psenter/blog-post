I guess I'll just format this like the last one.

### Question 1:

My thoughts on the roles of HTML, CSS, and JS are that they all work together very well to give a nice user experience. HTML is a nice structure for all of it, housing all of the text and images in the site that youre making/viewing. CSS adds on ways to add color, fonts, and resizing images and text to make the site more pleasing to the eye when its being viewed. (No one just wants to look at a white page with black text all day that would be boring.) Finally JS is a good way to add interactive things to the site for the user, such as ways to get to other pages on the site or just a simple button that turns the site to dark mode.

### Question 2:

My thoughts on puesdocode as of this time is that it is somewhat difficult. I dont necessarily know how to do a majority of things in JS let alone anything else so it is hard for my brain to come up with some things to put down into the puesdocode. I can see why it is used though, from what I have attempted it shows how easy it can be to give yourself guide lines without getting to lost in any code, as well as give others who look at your code a good idea of what is going on in case something gets sloppy or is unfinished.

### Question 3:

Something that made remote classes esasier was that it is pushed for us to ask for help and everyone is usually on their computer ready to help if they can, and having the access to help almost 24/7 is very nice. Instead of googling for help and attempting to understand what is going on I can ask for it and get an explanation that is easier for me to understand.

### Question 4:

Something that hindered my progress during onboarding was my own inability to ask for help. I would get very anxious about asking for help in the help channel and would spend a lot of time trying to figure out problems that I easily could have asked for help on but did not.

### Question 5:

The way I overcame challenges during onboarding was I took a lot of time trying to figure out how to solve my problems, I would google the issue I was having and look at multiple sites (stack overflow, quora, MDN, etc.) and would look at some of the examples on there trying to piece together something that could work for me. There were also times I looked into the help channel and I was able to find answers there if someone had the same issue as me, and there was a couple times I ended up just asking for help in the channel.
